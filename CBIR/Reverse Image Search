Yandex like reverse image search using a pretained Convolutional Neural Network (Resnet50) to extract image features 
and a Neural Network regression model to predict similarity measure between images. 

Achieved results better than with Euclidean distance between image features. 23,000 images were indexed for the search. 

Keras was used with tensorflow backend in a Google Compute instance.
